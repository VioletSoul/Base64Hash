# Interactive Text Encoder and Hasher with Tkinter

This Python application provides an interactive GUI to encode and hash input text using multiple classic algorithms. As you type, the app dynamically displays the results of various encodings and ciphers, including Base64, Base32, Hex, ROT13, Caesar cipher, Atbash cipher, XOR cipher, and cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256).

The interface is built with Tkinter and features a clean, color-coded output area for easy readability.

## Features

- Real-time encoding and hashing of input text
- Supports multiple classical ciphers and encodings
- Color-coded output for clarity
- Simple and responsive GUI using Tkinter

## Usage

Run the script with Python 3:

Type your text in the input field, and the encoded and hashed results will update automatically.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies)
